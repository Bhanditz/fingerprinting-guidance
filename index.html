      <h2>What is fingerprinting?</h2>
      <p>In short, <dfn>browser fingerprinting</dfn> is the capability of a site to identify or re-identify a visiting user, user agent or device via configuration settings or other observable characteristics.</p>
      <p>A more detailed list of types of fingerprinting is included below. A similar definition is provided by [[RFC6973]].</p>
    
        <section>
        <h2 id="privacy_threat_models">Privacy impacts and threat models</h2>

        <p>Browser fingerprinting can be used as a security measure (e.g. as means of authenticating the user). However, fingerprinting is also a potential threat to users' privacy on the Web. This document does not attempt to provide a single unifying definition of "privacy" or "personal data", but we highlight how browser fingerprinting might impact users' privacy. For example, browser fingerprinting can be used to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>identify a user</li>
          <li>track and correlate a user’s browsing activity within and across sessions</li>
          <li>collect information from which inferences can be drawn about a user</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The privacy implications associated with each use case are discussed below. Following from the practice of security threat model analysis, we note that there are distinct models of privacy threats for fingerprinting. Defenses against these threats differ, depending on the particular privacy implication and the threat model of the user.</p>

        <section>
          <h3>Identify a user</h3>
          <p>There are many reasons why users might wish to remain anonymous or unidentified online, including: concerns about surveillance, personal physical safety, concerns about discrimination against them based on what they read or write when using the Web. When a browser fingerprint is correlated with identifying information (like a real name), an application or service provider may be able to identify an otherwise pseudonymous user.</p>
          <p>Users concerned about physical safety from, for example, a governmental adversary might employ onion routing systems such as Tor to limit network-level linkability but still face the danger of browser fingerprinting to correlate their Web-based activity.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
          <h3>Unexpected correlation of browsing activity</h3>
          <p>Fingerprinting provides privacy concerns even when real-world identities are not implicated. Some users may be surprised or concerned that an online party can correlate multiple visits (on the same or different sites) to develop a profile or history of the user. This concern may be heightened because it may occur without the user's knowledge or consent and tools such as clearing cookies do not prevent or &#8220;re-set&#8221; correlation done via browser fingerprinting.</p>
        </section>
        
        <section>
          <h3>Inferences about a user</h3>
          <p>The observable characteristics used for browser fingerprinting can themselves reveal information from which inferences can be drawn about a user. For example, the OS version and CPU information might be used to draw inferences about a user’s purchasing power or proclivity (<a href="#wsj-orbitz">for example</a>). Users may consider this an unwelcome intrusion into their privacy even if they remain unidentified. Additionally, decisions might be made based on these inferences (e.g. which offers to display and at what price) that users perceive as discriminatory and an instance of being singled out and treated differently. This intrusion is compounded when browser fingerprints are correlated with user credentials, purchasing histories and other information about the user (e.g. cross-site browsing histories).</p>
        </section>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Fingerprinting mitigation levels of success</h2>
        <p>There are also different levels of success in addressing browser fingerprinting:</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Decreased fingerprinting surface:</li>
        <li>Increased anonymity set: </li>
        <li>Client-preventable fingerprinting: </li>
        <li>Externally detectable fingerprinting: </li>
        </ul>
    </section>
    </section>


    <section>
        <h2 id="types_of_fingerprinting">Types of fingerprinting</h2>
        <section>
          <h3 id="passive">Passive</h3>
          <p><dfn>Passive fingerprinting</dfn> is browser fingerprinting based on characteristics observable in the contents of Web requests, without the use of any code executing on the client side.</p>
          <p>Passive fingerprinting would trivially include cookies (often unique identifiers sent in HTTP requests) and the set of HTTP request headers and the IP address and other network-level information. The <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2616#section-14.43">User-Agent string</a>, for example, is an HTTP request header that typically identifies the browser, renderer, version and operating system. For some populations, the user agent string and IP address will commonly uniquely identify a particular user's browser [[NDSS-FINGERPRINTING]].</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3 id="active">Active</h3>
          <p>For <dfn>active fingerprinting</dfn>, we also consider techniques where a site runs JavaScript or other code on the local client to observe additional characteristics about the browser. Techniques for active fingerprinting might include accessing the window size, enumerating fonts or plug-ins, evaluating performance characteristics, or rendering graphical patterns.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
          <h3 id="cookie_like_setting_retrieving_local_state">Cookie-like (setting/retrieving local state)</h3>
          <p>Users, user agents and devices may also be re-identified by a site that first sets and later retrieves state stored by a user agent or device. This <dfn>cookie-like fingerprinting</dfn> allows re-identification of a user or inferences about a user in the same way that HTTP cookies allow state management for the stateless HTTP protocol [[RFC6265]].</p>
          <p>Cookie-like fingerprinting can also circumvent user attempts to limit or clear cookies stored by the user agent, as demonstrated by the "evercookie" implementation [[EVERCOOKIE]]. Where state is maintained across user agents (as in the case of common plugins with local storage), across devices (as in the case of certain browser syncing mechanisms) or across software upgrades, cookie-like fingerprinting can allow re-identification of users, user agents or devices where active and passive fingerprinting might not.</p>
